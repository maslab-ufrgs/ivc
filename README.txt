This project contains code for inter-vehicular communication experiments with SUMO.

The drivers intelligence is implemented in a module that controls the traffic simulation in SUMO via its implementation of TraCI architecture.

The main script, which performs the experiments, is src/ivcexperiment.py.

The VehicleTyper project (https://wiki.inf.ufrgs.br/Vehicle_Typer) was also added to this repository.
